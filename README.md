# React tutorial and starter kit project

Check the tutorial: [How to React - Tutorial](http://vasconita.github.io/how-to-react/)

For the moment, the tutorial is only in Spanish. I'll translate into English soon.

Presentation have been made with [Slides.com](http://slides.com/joseantoniocortesdavila/introduccion-a-react), you can fork me there if you want. I will make a markdown-based presentation, in order to accept fixes, improvements and new languages via PRs.
